# Dungeons of Crimsonbranch - Extras

Here you can find some extras about **{{gameName}}**.

### Game board
You can print a reusable _Game board_ by inserting a single name in the game _Print_ game screen. You can use the game board to keep multiple counters using tokens instead of writing and erasing them on the character sheet.

#### Enemies trackers
The first 7 rows are _Enemy trackers_. When you've to record a new enemy:

 - Pick 1 empty row
 - Place 1 token on the icon box matching the enemy type
 - Place 2 tokens on the numbered box in the track matching the enemy _Strength_
 - If the enemy has a _Shield_: place 1 token under the {glyph defense} box ({glyph defense} enemies are never shielded by the rules so you'll never 2 tokens on this box)

When breaking the enemy shield remove the token on the {glyph defense} icon.

When dealing damage to the enemy move the leftmost token on the numbered boxes to the left - or any of them if they're at the same position: the other token is not moved and it will keep tracking the enemy's _Strength_, that is its damage and maximum health.

Enemies are alive when there are 2 tokens on numbered boxes. When an enemy is defeated remove its health points tracking token and keep the _Strength_ tracking token: it's now a dropped item with that _Quality_.

When a dropped item is removed remove all the tokens from the row.

#### Shield trackers
The 8th row is a _Shield tracker_. All the enemies have the same _Shield_ value by the rules so the tracker works for all _Shielded_ enemies. When you've to record the enemies defense:

 - Sum the _Strength_ value of {glyph defense} enemies as usual
 - Place a token on the track at the sum value

When the enemies are unshielded remove the token from the track.

#### Hero trackers
The next rows are used to track the hero _HP_, _HP/XP Max_, and _XP_ values. Use 2 tokens for each row: one for tens and one for units. If the stat number is below 10 remove the token on the tens.

#### Other trackings
The hero level, skill points, and items, time and skill tree branch activations will be still tracked by writing on the character sheet with a pencil.
